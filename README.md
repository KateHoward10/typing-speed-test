# Typing Speed Test
This app was a bit of practice using TypeScript in React, which seems appropriate as it involves typing.

The literary passages are being fetched from [Lit Ipsum](https://litipsum.com/), and are much easier to copy out than Lorem Ipsum even if some of the punctuation gets a bit silly.

Icons are from Font Awesome via [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).
